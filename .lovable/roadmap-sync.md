CI443 surfaced GHSA-vfj7-8cjw-p6xm in braces3.0.3 (no patched braces release).
The existing override mechanism pins Chokidar4.0.3, removing braces and its unused
transitives. TanStack watches a literal route directory; unstorage watches its
base directory and supports Chokidar4. Two actual watcher tests cover add/change/
unlink and storage notifications. bun audit is clean (627 packages); no gate is
disabled. Reference: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vfj7-8cjw-p6xm and
